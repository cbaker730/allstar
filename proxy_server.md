To set up a proxy server for your AllStar node when using a mobile hotspot, you can follow these steps:

## Choose a Proxy Service

Select a reliable proxy service that supports the protocols needed for AllStar (typically IAX2). Some options include:

- Squid Proxy
- Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Cloud-based proxy services

## Set Up the Proxy Server

1. Install the proxy software on a stable internet connection (e.g., a cloud server or home network).

   apt update
   apt install squid

2. Configure the proxy to allow traffic on the necessary ports for AllStar (usually 4569 for IAX2).

   # Squid normally listens to port 3128
   http_port 4569 

3. Set up authentication to secure your proxy access.

   printf "linuxconfig:$(openssl passwd 'Passw0rd1!')\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/squid/httpauth

   Added to /etc/squid/squid.conf:

   auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/httpauth
   auth_param basic realm proxy
   acl myauth proxy_auth REQUIRED


   http_access allow myauth    # has to be above http_access deny all


   sudo systemctl restart squid
   sudo ufw allow 'Squid'

   

   

## Configure Your AllStar Node

1. Modify the `iax.conf` file on your AllStar node to use the proxy server:

```
[general]
bindaddr=0.0.0.0
bindport=4569
register => username:password@your_proxy_ip:proxy_port
```

2. Update the `extensions.conf` file to route traffic through the proxy.

## Connect via Mobile Hotspot

1. Enable your mobile hotspot on your smartphone.

2. Connect your AllStar node to the mobile hotspot.

3. The node will now communicate through the proxy server, providing a more stable connection as you move between cell towers.

## Additional Considerations

- Use dynamic DNS to maintain a consistent address for your proxy server.
- Implement encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) for secure communication between your node and the proxy.
- Regularly update your proxy server software to ensure security and performance.

By using a proxy server, you can maintain a more stable connection for your AllStar node when using a mobile hotspot, even as your IP address changes while traveling.
